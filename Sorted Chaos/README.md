# **Sorted Chaos**

## **Problem Statement**
Ethan, a programmer who thrives on structure, is challenged by his friend Max, who loves randomness. Max presents Ethan with multiple words and asks him to restore order by sorting all their characters in lexicographical order.

Ethan’s task is:
- Read an integer **n**, which indicates the number of words in the test case.
- Read the next **n** words, remove all spaces, and sort all characters in lexicographical order.
- Output the final sorted sequence of characters.

Can you help Ethan bring order to the chaos?

## **Input**
Each test case consists of two lines:
- The first line contains an integer **n** (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵) — the number of words in this test case.
- The second line contains **n** words consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the total number of characters across all test cases does not exceed **2 × 10⁵**.

---

## **Output**
For each test case, print a single line containing the sorted sequence of characters.
